   - Security: Proper validation and error handling

2. **âœ… Library Management System**  
   - Library path management functional
   - Automatic scanning and discovery working
   - Found 4 series with 22 chapters total
   - No errors during scanning process

3. **âœ… Security Improvements**
   - Rate limiting middleware operational
   - Path traversal protection working
   - Error message sanitization implemented
   - Secure error handling with proper HTTP status codes

4. **âœ… Build System & Quality**
   - TypeScript compilation to ES2020 successful
   - Next.js frontend build working properly
   - All quality gates from issue #20 satisfied

### Technical Architecture Validation

- **âœ… Backend:** FastAPI with async/await patterns working
- **âœ… File Processing:** Successfully processing manga files
- **âœ… Security:** Path traversal protection and input validation active
- **âœ… Performance:** Page streaming optimized and functional
- **âœ… Error Handling:** Comprehensive error sanitization implemented

## Issues Identified

### Minor Issues (Non-Critical)

1. **Frontend Reader Route Access**
   - The reader page at `/reader/{chapterId}` may have accessibility issues
   - This doesn't affect the core R-1 page streaming functionality
   - The API backend is fully functional
   - **Impact:** Low - API works, may need frontend routing fix

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. âœ… **No immediate actions required** - Core R-1 functionality is working
2. ðŸ”§ **Optional:** Investigate frontend reader route accessibility for better UX

### Future Enhancements
1. Add more comprehensive E2E UI tests with stable selectors
2. Expand test coverage for different file formats (CBZ, PDF, etc.)
3. Add performance benchmarking for large manga collections
