# KireMisu Development Context
_Last updated: 2025-08-02_

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

KireMisu is a self-hosted, cloud-first manga reader and library management system designed to provide a unified platform for manga collection management, reading, and discovery. This is a fresh start building on lessons learned from a previous iteration, focusing on practical user experience and robust design.

### Core Vision
- **Unified Library**: Collect, organize, and read all manga in one place
- **Cloud-First & Self-Hosted**: Web application designed for Docker/Kubernetes deployment
- **Metadata-Rich Experience**: Extensive metadata from external sources (MangaDx) with user curation
- **Personalization & Advanced Features**: Custom tagging, file organization, annotations, and API access
- **Offline Capability**: Download and export content for offline reading

## Architecture Overview
### Reference Documentation
- **Tech Stack**: See docs/kiremisu_tech_stack.md for complete architecture decisions and rationale
- **Database Schema**: See docs/kiremisu_data_model.md for comprehensive schema documentation
- **Testing Guidelines**: See .claude/rules/testing.md for detailed test strategy

### Key Technologies
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python 3.13+ with async performance
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16+ with JSONB for flexible metadata
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.4+ + React 19+ + TypeScript
- **Deployment**: Docker + Kubernetes for self-hosted flexibility

### Core Principles
- **Self-Hosted First**: All features work in isolated environments
- **File System as Source of Truth**: Never modify user files without permission
- **Graceful Degradation**: Core features work even if external APIs are unavailable
- **Performance for Large Libraries**: Design for thousands of series and chapters

API SPec for Mangadex is at https://api.mangadex.org/docs/swagger.html

## Database Design

### Key Decisions
- **PostgreSQL + JSONB**: ACID compliance with flexible metadata schema

## Recently Completed Sessions

### LL-2 Library Path CRUD - 2025-08-03

**What was completed:**
- ✅ Database schema for `library_paths` table was already included in the initial migration (cf4815a2275e) with proper indexes and constraints
- ✅ Created complete FastAPI backend structure:
  - Database connection layer with async session management (`backend/kiremisu/database/connection.py`)
  - Pydantic v2 schemas with validation (`backend/kiremisu/database/schemas.py`)
  - Service layer with comprehensive CRUD operations and validation (`backend/kiremisu/services/library_path.py`)
  - RESTful API endpoints with proper error handling (`backend/kiremisu/api/library.py`)
- ✅ Built comprehensive frontend UI:
  - Settings page with library path management (`frontend/src/app/settings/page.tsx`)
  - Reusable UI components using shadcn/ui design system
  - Form handling with validation and error reporting
  - Toast notifications for user feedback
  - Directory picker interface (placeholder for file system access)
  - Scan interval dropdown with predefined options (1 hour to 1 week)
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage:
  - Unit tests for service layer functionality (`tests/services/test_library_path.py`)
