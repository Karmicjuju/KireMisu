# KireMisu Development Context
_Last updated: 2025-08-02_

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

KireMisu is a self-hosted, cloud-first manga reader and library management system designed to provide a unified platform for manga collection management, reading, and discovery. This is a fresh start building on lessons learned from a previous iteration, focusing on practical user experience and robust design.

### Core Vision
- **Unified Library**: Collect, organize, and read all manga in one place
- **Cloud-First & Self-Hosted**: Web application designed for Docker/Kubernetes deployment
- **Metadata-Rich Experience**: Extensive metadata from external sources (MangaDx) with user curation
- **Personalization & Advanced Features**: Custom tagging, file organization, annotations, and API access
- **Offline Capability**: Download and export content for offline reading

## Development Guidelines for Commit & PR Creation

### PR Creation Standards
- Draft the commit and create the PR based on our standards and do not add any contributor information
- Ensure all deliverables are implemented and demonstrable in PR description
- Provide comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, E2E)
- Verify CI/CD pipeline passes all checks
- Clean lint and format (Ruff, ESLint/Prettier)
- Update relevant documentation sections
- Ensure no TODOs/FIXMEs remain within the scope
- Append a session hand-off note to CLAUDE.md under "Recently Completed Sessions"
