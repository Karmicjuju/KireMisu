## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python 3.13+ with async performance
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ + TypeScript with SSR
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16+ with JSONB for flexible metadata
- **File Processing**: PIL + PyMuPDF + rarfile for manga formats
- **Background Jobs**: PostgreSQL-based job queue
- **Development**: Modern tooling with Ruff, UV, and pre-commit hooks

## 🚀 Quick Start (Development)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 16+ (or use Docker)
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional but recommended)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd KireMisu
   ```

2. **Set up the development environment**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/dev.sh setup
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. **Start with Docker (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/dev.sh docker-dev
   ```

   Or start services individually:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Database
   ./scripts/dev.sh db-setup
   ./scripts/dev.sh db-migrate

   # Terminal 2: Backend
   ./scripts/dev.sh backend

   # Terminal 3: Frontend
   ./scripts/dev.sh frontend
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/api/docs

## 🛠️ Development Commands

Use the development helper script for common tasks:

```bash
# Setup everything
./scripts/dev.sh setup

# Start services
./scripts/dev.sh backend     # Start backend server
./scripts/dev.sh frontend    # Start frontend server
./scripts/dev.sh docker-dev  # Start with Docker Compose

# Database operations
./scripts/dev.sh db-setup    # Setup PostgreSQL database
./scripts/dev.sh db-migrate  # Run migrations
./scripts/dev.sh db-reset    # Reset database (drops all data)

# Code quality
./scripts/dev.sh lint        # Run linting
./scripts/dev.sh format      # Format code
./scripts/dev.sh test        # Run tests

# Docker management
./scripts/dev.sh docker-stop    # Stop Docker development environment
./scripts/dev.sh docker-clean   # Clean up all KireMisu containers
./scripts/dev.sh docker-reset   # Clean containers and start fresh

# Troubleshooting
./scripts/dev.sh ports          # Check and handle port conflicts
./scripts/dev.sh clean          # Clean build artifacts
```

### 🔧 Development Workflows

For common development scenarios, use the workflow helper:

```bash
# Start completely fresh (recommended after tests)
./scripts/dev-workflow.sh fresh-start

# Run tests with automatic cleanup
./scripts/dev-workflow.sh test-cleanup

# Restart development environment (handles port conflicts)
./scripts/dev-workflow.sh restart-dev

# Emergency stop all containers and free ports
./scripts/dev-workflow.sh emergency-stop

# Check status of all services
./scripts/dev-workflow.sh status
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Key environment variables (see `.env.example` for full list):

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `SECRET_KEY`: JWT secret key for authentication
- `MANGA_STORAGE_PATHS`: JSON array of manga library paths
- `MANGADX_API_URL`: MangaDx API endpoint
- `DEBUG`: Enable debug mode for development

### Storage Setup

Configure manga library paths in your `.env` file:

```bash
MANGA_STORAGE_PATHS=["/path/to/your/manga/library"]
```

In Docker deployments, mount your manga directories as volumes.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Port Conflicts
If you get "port already in use" errors:

```bash
# Check what's using the ports
./scripts/dev-workflow.sh status

# Handle port conflicts automatically
./scripts/dev.sh ports

# Nuclear option - stop everything
./scripts/dev-workflow.sh emergency-stop
```

### Container Issues
If containers won't start or behave unexpectedly:

```bash
# Clean restart
./scripts/dev-workflow.sh restart-dev

# Complete fresh start (recommended)
./scripts/dev-workflow.sh fresh-start

# Manual cleanup
./scripts/dev.sh docker-clean
docker system prune -f  # Clean up Docker system
```

### Database Issues
If database connections fail:

```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
./scripts/dev-workflow.sh status

# Reset database completely
./scripts/dev.sh db-reset

# Manual database check
docker exec -it kiremisu-postgres-dev psql -U kiremisu -d kiremisu
```

### Development Environment Issues
If the development environment seems broken:

```bash
# Fresh start with full cleanup
./scripts/dev-workflow.sh fresh-start

# Reset everything including dependencies
./scripts/dev.sh clean
./scripts/dev.sh setup
./scripts/dev.sh docker-dev
```

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

### Development
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

### Production
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Kubernetes
Kubernetes manifests will be provided in future releases for cloud-native deployments.

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# All tests
./scripts/dev.sh test

# Backend only
cd backend && pytest

# Frontend type checking
cd frontend && npm run type-check
```

## 📋 Roadmap
