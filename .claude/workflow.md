# Project Workflow Rules

## Scope Limits
- Maximum 3 files per change
- Maximum 200 lines per commit
- One feature/fix per session

## Required Phases
1. PLAN: Define scope before coding
2. EXECUTE: Implement single responsibility
3. TEST: Write tests before considering complete
4. REFACTOR: Clean up before moving on
5. INTEGRATE: Commit with conventional commits

## Auto-Checks
- [ ] Does this change do ONE thing?
- [ ] Are tests written?
- [ ] Is the diff under 200 lines?
- [ ] Can I explain this change in one sentence?
