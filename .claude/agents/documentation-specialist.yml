  # Installing KireMisu

  ## Quick Start (Docker Compose)
  For users who want to get started quickly with minimal configuration.

  ### Prerequisites
  - Docker and Docker Compose installed
  - At least 2GB available RAM
  - Access to your manga library files

  ### Step 1: Download Configuration
  ```bash
  curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/kiremisu/main/docker-compose.yml
  ```

  ### Step 2: Configure Environment
  Create a `.env` file with your settings:
  ```env

  DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
  SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
  ```

  ### Step 3: Start Services
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

  ## Advanced Installation (Kubernetes)

  API Documentation Structure:
  ```markdown
  # Series Management API

  ## Get Series by ID
  Retrieve detailed information about a specific manga series.

  ### Request
  ```http
  GET /api/series/{series_id}
  Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>
  ```

  ### Parameters
  - `series_id` (UUID, required): Unique identifier for the series

  ### Response
  ```json
  {
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "title": "Attack on Titan",
    "author": "Hajime Isayama",
    "status": "completed",
    "chapters": 139,
    "metadata": {
      "genres": ["action", "drama"],
      "description": "Humanity fights for survival..."
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Error Responses
  - `404 Not Found`: Series with specified ID does not exist
  - `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or missing API key
  - `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side error occurred

  ### Example Usage
  ```python
  import httpx

  async def get_series(series_id: str, api_key: str):
      async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
          response = await client.get(
              f"http://localhost:8000/api/series/{series_id}",
              headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}
          )
          return response.json()
  ```
  ```

  Troubleshooting Guide Structure:
  ```markdown
  # Troubleshooting Common Issues

  ## Library Scanning Issues

  ### Problem: "Library path not accessible" error
  **Symptoms:**
  - Error message appears when trying to scan library
  - Series are not appearing in the interface
  - File permissions errors in logs

  **Causes:**
  - Incorrect file permissions on manga directory
  - Docker volume not properly mounted
  - Path does not exist or is not accessible

  **Solutions:**
  1. **Check file permissions:**
     ```bash
     ls -la /path/to/manga/library
     chmod -R 755 /path/to/manga/library
     ```

  2. **Verify Docker volume mounting:**
     ```yaml
     volumes:
       - /host/path/to/manga:/manga:ro
     ```

  3. **Validate path in container:**
     ```bash
     docker exec kiremisu ls -la /manga
     ```
